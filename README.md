# Near-Field_Far-Field
(1) The repository provides two ways of channel modelling, i.e., the unified channel model (the elemment of which is determined by the BS-UAV antenna pair distance) and the far-field channel model (which is parameterized by AoA/AoD), to illustrate the difference between far-field and near-field wireless channels.\\
(2) The code can be used in simulations for the MIMO communication link with arbitary Tx/Rx array shapes and orientations.\\
(3) For details of the code, please refer to “Jittering effects analysis and beam training design for UAV millimeter wave communications,” IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, vol. 21, no. 5, pp. 3131-3146, May 2022.
