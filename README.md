# Near-Field_Far-Field
The repository provides two ways of channel modelling, i.e., the unified channel model (the elemment of which is determined by the BS-UAV antenna pair distance) and the far-field channel model (which is parameterized by AoA/AoD),  to illustrate the difference between far-field and near-field wireless channels.
